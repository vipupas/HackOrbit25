Problem Statement

  Modern cities face severe traffic congestion due to non-adaptive traffic light systems that:

    Use fixed signal timings

    Cause unnecessary delays

    Increase fuel consumption and pollution

    Perform poorly during peak hours or uneven traffic loads

Proposed Solution

  An AI-powered dynamic traffic signal system that:

    Analyzes real-time traffic density using CCTV feeds

    Dynamically adjusts green light durations per lane

    Gives priority to emergency vehicles

    Supports deployment on edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano) or remote servers
